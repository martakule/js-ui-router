			divs[i].dataset.ui == hash?divs[i].style.display="block":divs[i].style.display="none";

			// using the same loop to access each of the links - if the href matches the #hash value set class to active - otherwise remove all classes
			links[i].href == window.location.origin+window.location.pathname+"#"+hash?links[i].className = "active":links[i].className="";

		/* 
			It is important to keep in mind that if the number of links with href starting with # and number of elements with data-ui differs the above
			loop will produce undesired results and both links/divs will have to be looped through separately.

			Another thing to keep in mind is that links with a hashtag set in href are used to access sections of a website by element IDs - if you have a div
			with the same ID as the links href then the browser will scroll to that section. This is the reason data-ui attributes are used instead of simply IDs.
